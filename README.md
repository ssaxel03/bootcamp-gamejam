# Summary
<p>In a world overrun by relentless zombies, Necro Nibbler thrusts players into a tense, top-down shooter experience where survival hinges on resource management and strategic decision-making. As the protagonist, you navigate through a sprawling, dilapidated facility teeming with undead foes, each room presenting a new challenge and a fresh horde to dispatch. The game blends fast-paced action with a need to conserve ammunition and funds, forcing players to balance aggressive combat with thoughtful resource allocation. Each encounter requires a keen eye for both the undead and the dwindling supplies at your disposal, as every bullet counts and every dollar can be the difference between life and death.

Players will face a variety of zombie types, each with unique behaviors and weaknesses, encouraging experimentation with different weapons and tactics. The facility is scattered with loot: abandoned weapons, health packs, and cash that can be used to upgrade gear. The challenge lies not only in slaying the hordes but also in making split-second decisions about when to fight, when to flee, and how best to use the limited resources. Players must assess their environment carefully, using traps, barricades, and strategic positioning to conserve ammunition and maximize their chances of survival.

As you progress deeper into the facility, the stakes rise, and the hordes become more formidable. Each room cleared brings you closer to escape, but it also increases the tension, as resource scarcity becomes more pronounced. Will you stockpile supplies for a tough fight ahead, or push forward with what little you have, risking it all for a chance at freedom? *Necro Nibbler* challenges players to adapt to an ever-changing battlefield while managing the critical balance of offense and resource preservation, creating a thrilling blend of strategic gameplay and relentless action in a post-apocalyptic setting.</p>
